# How it's work?
Embedding is the process of transforming data into some compact space that is easier to process and use for analysis. In machine learning, embedding is typically used to transform categorical data, such as text or images, into a vector representation. This allows machine learning algorithms to better understand and process data, which can improve model quality and results. Embedding can also be used to compress data and improve algorithm performance.
